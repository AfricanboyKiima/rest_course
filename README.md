The Django Rest Framework is a flexible and powerful toolkit(set of software tools) that allows developers to create web api's using the python programming language.
We are building two applications within the project:
    1. One to contain all the logic about the contact endpoint(a digital location for requesting specific resources to an api).
    2. Another to contain all logic for Items and orders endpoints
